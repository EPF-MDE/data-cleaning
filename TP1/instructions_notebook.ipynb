    "# TP 1 : Formatting and Sanitizing - Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "For this first practical assignment, we'll be working with data from _Montpellier mÃ©tropole_. You will be downloading the raw \"Defibrilators of Montpellier\" dataset (the one you've played with in CodinGame) and will write a loader script that cleans and loads a sane dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment will also be an opportunity to practice some test-oriented development.\n",
    "To build the loading script, you will proceed with the following steps: \n",
    "1. Test-oriented problem specification\n",
    "2. Implementation of the cleaning functions\n",
    "3. Validation with tests\n",
    "\n",
    "## Technical requisites\n",
    "Throughout this assignent you'll use multiple pandas functionalities such as:\n",
    "- drop useless columns\n",
    "- convert string types to numeric or datetime types\n",
    "- manipulating strings with `.str` (aka the string accessor)\n",
    "- checking strings for patterns using regular expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "To learn how to do this in Pandas, you may reffer to the following documents:\n",
    "- [\"Pythonic Data Cleaning With pandas and NumPy\",  by Malay Agarwal at RealPython.com](https://realpython.com/python-data-cleaning-numpy-pandas/)\n",
    "- [\"Working with text data\", at pandas docs](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/text.html#)\n",
    "- [\"Time series / date functionality\", at pandas docs](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/timeseries.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1. Problem specification\n",
    "Prepare some tests cases that ensure that your cleaning function works as expected:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Select a handful of examples (between 10 and 15) from your data that cover the problems you have identified\n",
    "2. With these examples, compose a sample dirty data file (`sample_dirty.csv`) that will serve as a testing reference.\n",
    "3. Manually compose a `pd.DataFrame` that corresponds to the `sample_dirty` data loaded with the correct types/formats (`sample_formatted`).\n",
    "4. Manually compose a `pd.DataFrame` where all the sanity problems got fixed (`sample_sanitized`).\n",
    "\n",
    "These test cases should be specified in the file `loader_test.py` where indicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2. Implementation of the cleaning functions\n",
    "Your loading function should be in a file `loader.py`. It should be as modular as possible. For instance:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "...\n",
    "\n",
    "def sanitize_dataframe(df:pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:\n",
    "    \"\"\" One function to do all sanitizing\"\"\"\n",
    "    df = (df.pipe(sanitize_adr_num)\n",
    "            .pipe(sanitize_adr_voie)\n",
    "            .pipe(sanitize_com_cp)\n",
    "            .pipe(sanitize_com_nom)\n",
    "            # ... add others (or remove) if necessary\n",
    "          )\n",
    "    return df\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "def load_clean_dataframe(df:pd.DataFrame)-> pd.DataFrame:\n",
    "    \"\"\"one function to run it all and return a clean dataframe\"\"\"\n",
    "    df = (df.pipe(load_formattted_dataframe)\n",
    "          .pipe(sanitize_dataframe)\n",
    "    )\n",
    "    return df\n",
    "```\n",
    "## Step 3. Validation\n",
    "Since the problem is defined in terms of test cases, verifying the task is completed consists in passing each of the test cases.\n",
    "The `loader_test.py` file contains testing functions that check each of them (assuming you implemented all the test cases). You can run them using `pytest`.\n",
